## Thursday
1. I completed all the exercises; however, I could not get exercise 4 to work as intended despite my best efforts. 
2. Solutions to exercise 1-3 can be found in the folder "03-thursday-exercises". I had some problems with exercise 4 despite following the guide. I have deployed my solution and it can be found [here](http://139.59.147.16:8080/week1day4-1.0/); however, it unfortunatly always throws a Servlet.init() exception, which I could not get the help to fix.

## Friday
1. I completed all the exercises; however, I could not get the deployment section/exercise to work as intended.
2. Solutions to the exercises can be found in the folder "04-friday-exercises". Again, I could not get the deployed version to work as intended, since I got the same exception as I got for Thursday's exercise 4.
